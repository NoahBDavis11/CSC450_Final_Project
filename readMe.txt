This is a database that can be used for the operation of a Disney park. It stores information on employees, park locations, buildings, rides, repairs, concessions and events. It is stored what employees operate which consessions, perform which repairs, operate which rides, host which events, and reside in which buildings. For events, rides, and concessions it is stored which section of the park and building they are in. Rides have a set of restrictions for who may ride it based on what ride it is. Repairs have a set of replacement parts based on the ride and repair. Through the front-end one will be able to navigate links to a list of all park events, a list of all park rides, a list of all park concessions, find repair details, find repair part details, find employee details, add a new employee, add a new repair, and add a new event.
